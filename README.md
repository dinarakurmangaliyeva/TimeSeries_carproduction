# Time Series Analysis of Car Production in Spain

This repository contains files related to the analysis of the "Turismos" dataset, which captures monthly car production in Spain. The project applies advanced statistical modeling techniques, including the Box-Jenkins ARIMA methodology, to model and forecast car production trends. 

## Files Included

1. **TimeSeries_CodeAnalysis.Rmd**  
   The R Markdown file containing the detailed code used for data exploration, transformation, and time series modeling.

2. **TimeSeries_FinalReport.pdf**  
   The final report documenting the methodology, analysis, and results, including model evaluation and predictions for car production trends.

3. **Turismos.dat**  
   The dataset used for the analysis, representing monthly car production in Spain from 1994 onward.

4. **TimeSeries_CodeOutput.html**  
  HTML report containing the detailed code used for data exploration, transformation, and time series modeling.

## Key Highlights

- **Goal:** Forecast car production trends by modeling seasonality and calendar effects using ARIMA models.
- **Tools Used:** R programming for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
- **Findings:** Identified optimal ARIMA models for accurate prediction and explored seasonal and trend dynamics.
